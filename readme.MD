JS-Code-Quiz

During the course of this assingment, lots of research time, googling, and self sudy has been done.

This  app  helped me  learn how to manipulate DOM elements  to get local storage that enables to store users information in local computer, which can be later retrieved.

Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:


-A the landing page click the "View Highscores" button to check out your score compared to your peers.

-The timer starts When you click the "Start Quiz". 
User need to click on the answer that is the overall timers for about 90 second.
They need to quickly and correctly results in a higher score.
 Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty and  cause the user to get lower score and when users enters his/her initial, the timer stops and they are presented with their final sore based on the questions they got right or wrong.

 It was a great learing experience.

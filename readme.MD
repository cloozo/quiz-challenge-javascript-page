JS-Code-Quiz

## Jascript-Code-Quiz Challenge

# During the course of this assingment, lots of research time, googling, and self sudy has been done.

The creation of this app  helped me  learn how I can select different Html elements to manipulate DOM, using different methods like the "getElementsbyId" and "querySelector" and "querySelectorAll" to then apply different behavior though the elements and buttons. I use the "addEventistener"  method to help achieve that. I also  use local storage to facilitate the  storage of users information like their initial and score in local computer, which later can be conveniently retrieved. There is also a Countdown timer to control the time which will deduct points from the user score if they miss a question.

## Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:


* At the landing page , there is a click the "View Highscore" button to check out your score compared to your peers.

* The timer starts When you click the "Start Quiz". 

User need to click on the answer that is the overall timers for a specific amount of seconds..
They need to quickly and correctly results in a higher score.
 Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty and  cause the user to get lower score and when users enters his/her initial, the timer stops and they are presented with their final sore based on the questions they got right or wrong.

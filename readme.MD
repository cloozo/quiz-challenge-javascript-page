Javascript-Code-Quiz-Challenge 2021

## Javascript-Code-Quiz Challenge

# During the course of this assignment, lots of research time, googling, and self-study has been done.

* The creation of this app helped me learn how I can select different Html elements to manipulate DOM, using different methods like the "getElementsbyId" and "querySelector" and "querySelectorAll" to apply different behavior through the elements and buttons. I use the "addEventistener"  method to help achieve that.

 I also use local storage to facilitate storing of users information like their initial and score in local computer, which later can be conveniently retrieved.
 
  There is also a Countdown timer to control the time which will deduct points from the user score if they miss a question.

## Use of the site can be summed up with the following user story:


* At the landing page, there is a click the "View Highscore" button to check out your score compared to your peers.

* The timer starts When you click the "Start Quiz". 

The user needs to click on the right answer. If they choose the wrong answer, points will be deducted from their score while the timer is still running.

 Answering incorrectly will result in a time reduction penalty and  cause the user to get a lower score. At the end of the quiz,  the user enters his/her initial. The timer stops and they are presented with their final score based on the questions they got right or wrong.

 Overall, it was a great learning experience.
